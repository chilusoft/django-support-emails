# django-support-emails
This is a django-specific Library that becomes useful on every website that needs the functionality to add Support Services to their website.
The Library gathers the email address of the website visitor, their names as well as the message that they are sending to web admins. An email 
is automatically sent to the email that is configured in the django settings.py file and generates a random ticket support number.
